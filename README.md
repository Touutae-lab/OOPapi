# Developer Message

Note: This program may not be a right tool for an online game. However, we would like to explore how possible it could be to make such one-time request and response pairs.
However, if you wish to create your own online game, please try more suitable tool like [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) or [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).
